agenda
* Brainstorm on HIE whitepaper changes
* Task identification
* Assignment of tasks to people other than John

HIE Work Item
* Goal add MHD/MHDS/mXDE/QEDm, keep leval of detail at same audience as current. Don't go deeper, technical, etc
* Timeline - Best possible: Public Comment at end of July face-to-face, publish October face-to-face
  * Longer is okay, quality is most important
* Assigned to John (who is willing to let others help)
* use GitHub
  * Streach: move primary content to MarkDown (abandon word), Public Comment using PDF rendering with line numbers, toy with using github issues and pull requests?
* Ultimately replace current HIE whitepaper from 2012
* TCON: June 9th 11am, July 7th 11am

Tasks

* Add mXDE and QEDM as a client enabling solution
* Add decision tree on when to use which of the sharing exchanges
* Remove NAV
* Update figures, while keeping them simple
* Review DSUB text is still representing current DSUB concepts given changes in DSUB in last 8 years

* Make clear how PDQm and PDQ are used as a front end to XCPD backend
* update the PUSH technologies that would explain that we have solutions (XDR, XCDR, XDM+e-mail, and MHD) 
  * to help profiles like 360X be able to treat push as a well-established concept
* make clear about static vs on-demand vs defered-creation
* More clear discussion of IHE document content profiles
  * Point at wiki page for content profiles (CDA, XDW, and FHIR-Document)
